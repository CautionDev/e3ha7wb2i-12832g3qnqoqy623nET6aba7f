# Description

The key to winning any football (soccer) match is positioning. That's why the simple and fun Soccer Physics eschews any complex control schemes and tactical analysis, and breaks it all down to a single button. That's right, you control your team with a single button and try to get that ball into your opponent's goal. Jump at just the right moment to make the ball bounce off of you and into the other player's goal. Make sure you don't accidentally put it into your own! Laugh hysterically with a friend as your wacky footballers leap, jump and hop across the field.
