# Description

Agario is an addictive io game created by Matheus Valadares and published by Miniclip. In this fun-addicting multiplayer game it's all about to eat or to be eaten. But there are two simple rules to follow. First: you only can consume targets that are smaller than you as you should match the color to evolve yourself. Second: you must give larger objects a wide berth or you will die. Eat, grow, split, multiply and rule over other players of the free game Agario world wide. Enjoy the world of Agario!
