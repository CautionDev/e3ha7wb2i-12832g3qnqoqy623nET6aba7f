# What Happened before tetretalk?
  We started off as, nothing, it was just a project I thought about doing, at the time i didn't have a great computer
and i couldn't run simple things as Google Chrome Without it not saying NOT RESPONDING, i always hate this, i knew that there is a 
thing called Task manager, but the funny thing here is if i try and open task manager it starts not responding, i know right, but 
one day, was the best day ever, i got a computer that is fast! I had an IPad that i used most of the time.

# When i got a computer

  I took some time to think about what to do, i thought about just playing games like roblox but then i said " IM GONNA MAKE A ROBLOX!"
  I didn't make tetretalk just yet, i wanted to wait. I waited some time until August, I finally started tetretalk! 
  I started tetretalk, it started fast! Updates everyday, as i am typing this up, we are in 1 month of development, and we already
  have many fun features on this website, just look at everything on the menu, look how much we have changed overtime, at start,
  we only had 1 thing on the website which was games, the first update was the ability to publish games, and so on.
