# Description

How high can you go? The virtual trampoline in Flip Master lets you keep jumping towards ridiculous heights, as long as you keep showing off fancy spins, rolls and flips. Make your character pull of double, triple or even quadruple spins as you propel him towards the stratosphere. Make sure you avoid landing on your neck or the rim, because then your run will be cut short. Keep collecting coins that appear above you to improve your stats, buy new characters, unlock new locations or powerups. Explore everything Flip Master has to offer, but make sure you don't get dizzy along the way. Have fun!
