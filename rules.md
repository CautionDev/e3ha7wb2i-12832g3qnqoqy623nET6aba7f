### No Swearing when making a game - Little Kids play this ok

### Dont Hack us - Even though its basically impossible to hack us, don't try to, your gonna fail.

### If you dont like a new update don't go complaining to a staff member on the discord - Most likely they will have nothing to do with the update

### If you ever find a glitch/bug on a game on the website, dont tell the tetretalk staff, tell the developer of the game

# And Dont forget to Have Fun!
